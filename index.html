        I am a student in the Georgia Tech Coding Boot Camp where I am currently studying web development. I intend to use the knowledge gained in this program to pursue a career in full stack web development. Prior to this, I completed my Bachelor's degree at the University of Georgia in 2017. 
        During that time I majored in Communication Studies with a minor in History. My educational background shows that I have a well-rounded skill set to offer potential employers. Along with my knowledge of coding, I possess impeccable written and verbal communication skills which have a variety of potential applications.
